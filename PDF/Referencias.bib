abstract = {The incidence of penile cancer varies from country to country, with the highest figures reported for countries in Africa, South America, and Asia and lowest in the United States and Europe. Causes of this variation are not clear, but they are thought to be related to human papillomavirus infection, smoking, lack of circumcision, chronic inflammation, and poor genital hygiene. Most penile tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, and a variegated spectrum of distinct morphologies is currently recognized. Each one of these subtypes has distinctive pathologic and clinical features. About half of penile carcinomas are usual squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest corresponds to verrucous, warty, basaloid, warty-basaloid, papillary, pseudohyperplastic, pseudoglandular, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, and cuniculatum carcinomas. Previous studies have found a consistent association of tumor cell morphology and human papillomavirus presence in penile carcinomas. Those tumors composed of small- to intermediate-sized, basaloid ("blue") cells are often human papillomavirus positive, whereas human papillomavirus prevalence is lower in tumors showing large, keratinizing, maturing eosinophilic ("pink") cells. Human papillomavirus-related tumors affect younger patients, whereas human papillomavirus-unrelated tumors are seen in older patients with phimosis, lichen sclerosus, or squamous hyperplasia. This morphologic distinctiveness is also observed in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The specific aim of this review is to provide a detailed discussion on the macroscopic and microscopic features of all major subtypes of penile cancer. We also discuss the role of pathologic features in the prognosis of penile cancer, the characteristics of penile precursor lesions, and the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of invasive and precursor lesions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {ARID1A, a member of the chromatin remodeling genes family, has been suggested as a novel tumor suppressor gene in gynecologic malignancies. However, its role in penile cancer has yet to be determined. This study assesses the immunohistochemical expression of ARID1A in penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its association with pathologic features, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and previously reported mammalian target of rapamycin pathway markers in the same cohort. Four tissue microarrays were constructed from 112 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded penile SCC from Paraguay. Each tumor was sampled 3 to 12 times. ARID1A expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal rabbit anti-ARID1A (BAF250A) antibody. An H score was calculated in each spot as the sum of expression intensity (0-3+) by extent (0\%-100\%). Median H score per case was used for statistical analysis. ARID1A expression was observed in all cases, ranging from 3\% to 100\% of tumor cells (median, 95\%). In 96 cases (86\%), ARID1A expression was observed in 90\% or more tumor cells. HPV DNA was detected in 20 (38\%) of 52 analyzed samples. There was a significant trend of association between ARID1A and histologic grade. ARID1A expression was not associated with histologic subtype (P = .61) or HPV status (P = .18). ARID1A expression decreased with decreasing levels of PTEN expression (P = .01). ARID1A was expressed in penile SCC, in most cases at high levels. A significant trend of association was found between histologic grade and ARID1A expression, with lower ARID1A expression, lower histologic grades, and decreased PTEN expression.},

abstract = {The penile urethra has a distinctive morphology not yet fully characterized by immunohistochemistry. In addition, both urothelial and squamous cell carcinomas have been reported in the penile urethra, and the distinction between these 2 tumors might be difficult. The purposes of this study are to assess the histology and immunohistochemical profile (CK20, CK7, p63, and GATA3) of the penile urethra and to assess the usefulness of Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor (GATA3) and human papillomavirus detection in distinguishing urothelial versus squamous cell carcinomas. Normal penile urethra was evaluated in 11 total penectomies. The penile urethra was lined by 2 cell layers: a superficial single layer of CK7+, CK20-, and p63- columnar cells and a deep stratified layer of CK7-, CK20-, and p63+ cubical cells. Both layers were GATA3+, supporting urothelial differentiation. In addition, 2 tissue microarrays and 6 surgical specimens of primary tumors of the penile urethra (3 urothelial and 3 squamous cell carcinomas) were evaluated for GATA3 expression. In the tissue microarrays, 22 of 25 upper tract urothelial carcinomas and 0 of 38 penile squamous cell carcinomas were GATA3+. In the surgical specimens, GATA3 was positive in all urothelial carcinomas and negative in all squamous cell carcinomas. Human papillomavirus was detected in 2 of 3 squamous cell carcinomas and in 0 of 3 of the urothelial carcinomas. In conclusion, the penile urethra is covered by epithelial cells that are unique in morphology and immunohistochemical profile. In addition, our study suggests that GATA3 and human papillomavirus detection are useful markers for distinguishing urothelial carcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas of the penile urethra.},

abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate the immunoexpression of cyclin A1 in pT1 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder (UC) from a cohort of patients treated by transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), to determine its value in predicting tumour recurrence, tumour progression, or systemic metastases.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Five tissue microarrays (TMAS) were constructed from representative paraffin blocks of high-grade pT1 UC from 149 consecutive patients. Cyclin A1 immunoexpression was evaluated as the percentage of tumour cells with positive nuclear staining estimated at each TMA spot. The cutoff for cyclin A1 positivity was set at 10\% of cells. Outcome variables included tumour recurrence and tumour progression as the primary endpoints. Cyclin A1 positivity was associated with tumour progression but not with tumour recurrence or the presence of adjacent carcinoma in situ in the biopsy. Also, patients with pT1b at biopsy and cyclin A1 expression showed higher progression rates than patients with pT1a at biopsy and without cyclin A1 expression, respectively. Combining pT1 stage at biopsy and cyclin A1 expression more accurately predicted tumour progression than pT1 stage at biopsy alone and cyclin A1 expression alone.

CONCLUSIONS: Cyclin A1 immunoexpression is of potential utility in predicting disease progression in patients with pT1 UC.},

abstract = {The tissue microarray (TMA) of Kononen et al. is an extension of an idea originally developed by Battifora and consists of an array of cylindrical cores of paraffin-embedded tissue that are removed from preexisting "donor" paraffin blocks. The donor block is a standard tissue block that may be from surgical pathology, autopsy, or research material. A morphologically representative area of interest within the donor block is identified under the microscope using a stained section (usually hematoxylin and eosin stained) on a glass slide as a guide. The tissue cores are removed from the donor and inserted into a "recipient" paraffin block usually using a custom patented instrument from Beecher Instruments. Using a precise spacing pattern, tissues are inserted at high density, with up to 1000 tissue cores in a single paraffin block. Sections from this block that are cut with a microtome are placed onto standard slides that can then be used for in situ analysis. Depending on the overall depth of tissue remaining in the donor blocks, tissue arrays can generate between 100 and 500 sections. Once constructed tissue microarrays can be used with a wide range of techniques including histochemical staining, immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining, or in situ hybridization for either DNA or mRNA. In this chapter we present methods of TMA construction with emphasis on providing detailed tips and techniques.},

abstract = {Objectives: Infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of penile cancer in approximately 50\% of the patients. The gold standard for human papillomavirus (HPV) detection is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. However, technical requirements and associated costs preclude the worldwide use of PCR assays on a routine basis. Herein, we evaluated the predictive abilities of tumor morphology, immunohistochemistry for p16INK4a expression, and in situ hybridization (ISH) for HR-HPV detection in defining HPV status, as established by PCR. Materials and methods: Tissue samples from 48 patients with HPV-positive penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were included in 4 tissue microarrays (TMA). Results: Sensitivities and specificities were as follows: tumor morphology, 70\% and 68\%; p16INK4a immunohistochemistry, 65\% and 90\%; HR-HPV ISH, 47\% and 100\%. Regarding combinations of the predictors, the best performance was seen when HR-HPV ISH and p16INK4a immunohistochemistry were combined, regardless of the tumor morphology: sensitivity, 88\%; specificity, 64\%; area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) curve, 0.83. Combinations of tumor morphology with p16INK4a immunohistochemistry or with HR-HPV ISH performed similarly well. Conclusions: In penile SCC, both p16INK4a immunohistochemistry and ISH for HR-HPV increase the predictive ability of routine morphology in defining HPV status. These tests can be interpreted differentially, depending on the necessity of a higher sensitivity or a higher specificity. For research/screening studies, we recommend combining tumor morphology, p16INK4a immunohistochemistry, and HR-HPV ISH. To increase sensitivity, positivity in any of these predictors should be considered as indicative of HPV infection. For routine diagnosis of clinical cases, criteria should be more stringent, and, to achieve the highest specificity in classifying a case as HPV-related, all predictors should be consistently positive. The data generated in the present study could be used in algorithms for defining HPV status in penile carcinomas. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate immunohistochemical expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway members in pT1 urothelial carcinomas treated by transurethral resection and to determine if immunohistochemistry can be used to predict prognosis. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 156 patients with pT1 urothelial carcinoma treated by transurethral resection were used to build 5 tissue microarrays. Tissue microarray sections were stained for PTEN, phosphorylated (phos)-AKT, phos-mTOR, phos-S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), and phos-4EBP1. Patients were monitored after initial treatment (mean, 22.5; median, 16; range, 3-108 months) to detect tumor recurrence, tumor progression, or systemic metastases. Results: During follow-up, 101 patients (65\%) showed tumor recurrence, 57 showed tumor progression (37\%), and 18 showed systemic metastases (12\%). Patients with ≥2 lesions at the initial workup had higher proportions and higher hazard ratios of tumor recurrence, tumor progression, and systemic metastases. Complete loss of PTEN expression was observed in 6 patients (4\%), and >80\% of the mTOR pathway members showed at least focal positivity. Proportions of tumors with higher levels of PTEN immunohistochemical expression were higher in patients with tumor recurrence (P =.001), tumor progression (P =.05), and systemic metastases (P =.001). Proportions of tumors with lower phos-S6 and low phos-4EBP1 levels were higher in patients with tumor recurrence (P ≤.05). Proportions were similar for the remaining biomarkers. Conclusion: Higher levels of PTEN immunohistochemical expression were associated with higher rates of tumor recurrence, tumor progression, and systemic metastases in patients with pT1 urothelial carcinomas treated by transurethral resection. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Penile cancer is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence is relatively rare, but the highest in some developing countries. Insight into its precursor lesions, pathogenesis and risk factors offers options to prevent this potentially mutilating disease. This review presents an overview of the different histologically and clinically identified precursor lesions of penile cancer and discusses the molecular pathogenesis, including the role of HPV in penile cancer development. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature evaluating penile carcinogenesis, risk factors and molecular mechanisms involved. RESULTS: Careful monitoring of men with lichen sclerosis, genital Bowen's disease, erythroplasia of Queyrat and bowenoid papulosis seems useful, thereby offering early recognition of penile cancer and, subsequently, conservative therapeutic options. Special attention is given to flat penile lesions, which contain high numbers of HPV. Their role in HPV transmission to sexual partners is highlighted, but their potential to transform as a precursor lesion into penile cancer has been unsatisfactorily explored. CONCLUSIONS: Further research should not only focus on HPV mediated pathogenic pathways but also on the non-HPV related molecular and genetic factors that play a role in penile cancer development. Options for prevention of penile cancer include (neonatal) circumcision, limitation of penile HPV infections (either by prophylactic vaccination or condom use), prevention of phimosis, treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, limiting PUVA treatment, smoking cessation and hygienic measures.},

The mechanisms of action and toxicities of targeted therapies differ from those of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted therapies are generally better tolerated than traditional chemotherapy, but they are associated with several adverse effects, such as acneiform rash, cardiac dysfunction, thrombosis, hypertension, and proteinuria. Small molecule inhibitors are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and are subject to multiple drug interactions. Targeted therapy has raised new questions about the tailoring of cancer treatment to an individual patient's tumor, the assessment of drug effectiveness and toxicity, and the economics of cancer care. As more persons are diagnosed with cancer and as these patients live longer, primary care physicians will increasingly provide care for patients who have received targeted cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Disseminated penile cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy. However, response rates are far from acceptable. Recently, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies have shown to be clinically useful in penile carcinomas. Nevertheless, only a few cases of penile carcinomas have been evaluated for EGFR expression. In this study, we assessed the immunohistochemical expression of EGFR in 112 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. We built 4 tissue microarrays and evaluated EGFR expression using a monoclonal mouse anti-EGFR antibody. For digital image analysis, we used the open-source software ImageJ version 1.47 (NIH, Bethesda, MD) along with the immunomembrane plug-in. Membranous EGFR expression was evaluated, taking into account staining completeness (0-10 points) and staining intensity (0-10 points) for a combined score (0-20 points). We classified the cases as follows: negative EGFR expression, 0 to 3 points; low EGFR expression, 4 to 8 points; and high EGFR expression, 9 to 20 points. The distribution of EGFR immunohistochemical expression was as follows: 13 cases (12\%) were EGFR negative, 49 cases (44\%) had low EGFR expression, and 50 cases (44\%) had high EGFR expression. EGFR expression was not associated with histologic subtype (P =.47), histologic grade (P =.77), or human papillomavirus status (P =.14). In conclusion, immunohistochemical EGFR expression appears to be a common feature of penile carcinomas, independently of histologic subtype, histologic grade, and human papillomavirus presence. Whether or not EGFR expression is associated with EGFR gene mutation or if it can be used to predict response to therapy in patients with disseminated penile cancer should be evaluated in future studies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,658,370 new cancer cases and 589,430 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2015. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2007-2011), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates (13 oldest SEER registries) declined by 1.8\% per year in men and were stable in women, while cancer death rates nationwide decreased by 1.8\% per year in men and by 1.4\% per year in women. The overall cancer death rate decreased from 215.1 (per 100,000 population) in 1991 to 168.7 in 2011, a total relative decline of 22\%. However, the magnitude of the decline varied by state, and was generally lowest in the South (∼15\%) and highest in the Northeast (≥20\%). For example, there were declines of 25\% to 30\% in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York, and Delaware, which collectively averted 29,000 cancer deaths in 2011 as a result of this progress. Further gains can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population. CA Cancer J Clin 2015. © 2015 American Cancer Society.},

abstract = {Most penile cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) originating in the epithelium covering glans, coronal sulcus, and foreskin. Several histologic subtypes have been described, each with distinctive clinicopathologic and outcome features. The most common subtype is the usual SCC, representing one half to two thirds of penile carcinomas. Penile verruciform tumors encompass verrucous, warty (condylomatous), and papillary, not otherwise specified, carcinomas. As a group, verruciform tumors are low grade, with low metastatic and mortality rates. In contrast, basaloid and sarcomatoid carcinomas are among the most aggressive penile tumors. Other SCC variants, such as carcinoma cuniculatum and pseudohyperplastic, adenosquamous and acantholytic carcinomas, are rare. The most relevant clinicopathologic and outcome features are outlined for each of these SCC subtypes, and an algorithm that might aid the pathologist in the histologic classification is presented. In addition, recommendations for handling penile cancer specimens, frozen section specimens, and pathology reports are provided.},

abstract = {Background Penile cancer (PC) is a rare cancer in western countries, but is more common in parts of the developing world. Due to its rarity and the consequent lack of randomized trials, current therapy is based on retrospective studies and small prospective trials. Design Studies of PC therapy were searched in PubMed and abstracts at major conferences. Results PC is generally an aggressive malignancy characterized by early locoregional lymph node (LN) spread and later metastases in distant sites. Given the strong predictive value of LN involvement for overall survival, evaluating regional LNs is critical. Advanced LN involvement is increasingly being treated with multimodality therapy incorporating chemotherapy and/or radiation. A single superior cisplatin-based regimen has not been defined. Further advances may occur with a better collaboration on an international scale and comprehensive understanding of tumor biology. To this end, the preventive role of circumcision and understanding of the oncogenic roles of Human Papilloma Virus-16, and smoking may yield advances. Preliminary data suggest a role for agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor and angiogenesis. Conclusion Advances in therapy for PC will require efficient trial designs, synergistic collaboration, incentives to industry and the efforts of patient advocacy groups and venture philanthropists.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that penile cancer follows 2 etiologic pathways, 1 related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the other related to other factors including phimosis, chronic inflammation, and lichen sclerosus. HPV DNA is found in 47\% to 48\% of all penile tumors, and most of these cases correspond to high-risk genotypes, preferentially HPV-16. HPV status is associated with histologic subtype, with higher detection ratios in warty-basaloid carcinomas and lower detection ratios in keratinizing variants (ie, verrucous, papillary, and usual squamous cell carcinomas). It is the cell type, rather than a distinctive architecture, that is more strongly associated with HPV presence. The detection ratio is higher in tumors composed entirely or partially of cells with basaloid features. In addition, a few studies have evaluated the impact of HPV infection on the prognosis of patients with penile cancer. However, results are controversial, and more data are needed to clarify this matter. A proper understanding of the role of HPV in penile carcinogenesis might help in planning intervention strategies such as vaccination against HPV infection. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway-related biomarkers in penile carcinomas, and to assess associations with histological type, histological grade, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We built four tissue microarrays from 112 invasive penile squamous cell carcinomas, and evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-S6. We found decreased or loss of PTEN expression in 87\% of cases. Warty and/or basaloid carcinomas had a higher proportion of PTEN loss (P = 0.02), whereas keratinizing tumours showed higher levels of phospho-S6 (P = 0.009); phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR levels were not significantly different between warty/basaloid and keratinizing carcinomas (P = 0.75 and P = 0.77, respectively). PTEN was not associated with histological grade (P = 0.18). Expression levels of phospho-S6 were significantly higher in low-grade tumours (P = 0.001), whereas expression levels of phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR were slightly higher in high-grade tumours (P = 0.01 and P = 0.35, respectively). We did not find any association between HPV infection and mTOR markers (P ≥ 0.2 in all cases).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence of dysregulation of the mTOR pathway in penile carcinomas independently of HPV infection. Future clinical studies should further evaluate the prognostic and predictive usefulness of these markers in patients with penile cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The incidence of penile cancer is four times higher in Paraguay than in the United States or Europe. There are no adequate scientific explanations for this geographical variation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the interplay among risk factors, morphology of the primary tumor, and HPV status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Information on socioeconomic status, education level, habits, and sexual history was obtained in 103 Paraguayan patients with penile cancer. All patients were then treated by surgery, and specimens were evaluated histopathologically.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Patients usually dwelled in rural/suburban areas (82\%), lived in poverty (75\%), had a low education level (91\%), and were heavy smokers (76\%). Phimosis (57\%), moderate/poor hygienic habits (90\%), and history of sexually transmitted diseases (74\%) were frequently found. Patients with >10 lifetime female partners had an odds ratio of 3.8 (95\% CI 1.1, 12.6; P-trend = .03) for presenting HPV-positive tumors when compared to patients with <6 partners. However, this trend was not significant when the number of sexual partners was adjusted for age of first coitus and antecedents of sexually transmitted diseases. HPV-related tumors (found in 36\% of the samples) were characterized by a warty and/or basaloid morphology and high histological grade in most cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In our series, patients with penile cancer presented a distinctive epidemiologic and pathologic profile. These data might help explaining the geographical differences in incidence and aid in the design of strategies for cancer control in Paraguay.},
