<p>En esta sección se presenta la base de datos completa de los casos estudiados, incluyendo los valores obtenidos mediante la inspección visual y la evaluación digital. Se incluyen dos marcos de datos, el primero mostrando los valores obtenidos de hecho, y el segundo mostrando los valores máximos por cada caso. El libro de código describiendo cada variable se incluye con cada marco de datos.</p>

<h3>Por valores de hecho</h3>
<p>En esta subsección se muestra el marco de datos conteniendo todos los valores obtenidos de hecho, en cada foco de los microarrays tisulares (TMA). El libro de código se incluye a continuación:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>caso:</strong> variable categórica indicando la identificación del caso evaluado. En total, se evaluaron <code>113</code> casos.</li>
<li><strong>foco:</strong> variable numérica indicando el foco (“spot”) del TMA evaluado. Se debe tener en cuenta que cada caso presenta varios focos. El total de focos evaluados fue de <code>515</code> focos, luego de excluir focos con tejido normal de control y focos con menos del 10% de tejido tumoral.</li>
<li><strong>subtipo:</strong> variable categórica indicando el subtipo histologico del tumor observado en el foco. Los valores posibles incluyen los siguientes: <code>Usual, Condilomatoso-Basaloide, Condilomatoso, Basaloide, Papilar, Verrucoso, Sarcomatoide</code>.</li>
<li><strong>grado:</strong> variable categórica indicando el grado histológico del tumor observando en el foco. Los valores posibles incluyen los siguientes: <code>Grado 1, Grado 2, Grado 3</code>.</li>
<li><strong>p53v:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>p53</code>, estimado mediante inspección <code>visual</code>.</li>
<li><strong>p53d:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>p53</code>, estimado mediante análisis <code>digital</code>.</li>
<li><strong>k67v:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>Ki67</code>, estimado mediante inspección <code>visual</code>.</li>
<li><strong>k67d:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>Ki67</code>, estimado mediante análisis <code>digital</code>.</li>
<li><strong>cd1v:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>ciclina D1</code>, estimado mediante inspección <code>visual</code>.</li>
<li><strong>cd1d:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>ciclina D1</code>, estimado mediante análisis <code>digital</code>.</li>
<li><strong>m2v:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>MDM2</code>, estimado mediante inspección <code>visual</code>.</li>
<li><strong>m2d:</strong> variable numérica indicando el porcentaje de células tumorales positivas para la expresión inmunohistoquímica de <code>MDM2</code>, estimado mediante análisis <code>digital</code>.</li>
